This project, still in development, is a prototype of an open-world rogue-like RPG game.

The game will generate six large 2D worlds, filled with dungeons, treasures, and non-playable characters with whom the player can interact.

Despite being in a very early stage of development, the prototype already includes:

-A 2D procedural map generation system using Unity tilemaps. The system generates a noise map for height, temperature, and humidity, and then calculates what ecosystem is generated in each area. In addition, it has a wave system to alter the appearance of the maps, making them more natural and allowing to alter the frequency with which ecosystems appear procedurally from the inspector.

-A cell system, directly related to the map generation system, which allows the player to move through unoccupied cells.

-A procedural dungeon generation system, where the size of the dungeons can be easily edited. These dungeons can be populated with enemies and all kinds of objects. Additionally, a seed can be used to share favorite dungeon designs among users, just like in games like Bloodborne or Minecraft.

-A procedural NPC name generation system, with each NPC's name being totally distinct depending on their race.

-A procedural weapon name generation system, depending on the nature of the weapon (its type and rarity).

-A procedural faction name generation system, which includes the different NPCs in the game.

Overall, when the demo is ready, the player will be able to immerse themselves and explore a completely unique world, full of dungeons, treasures, and unrepeatable characters.

The project makes extensive use of the popular Unity asset "Odin Inspector". In addition, it uses free art assets as placeholders.
